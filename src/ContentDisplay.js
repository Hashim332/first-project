        I completed my Bachelor of Science in Physics from the University of
        Nottingham in 2023. During my academic journey, I gained a strong
        foundation in complex calculus, mathematical modelling, and programming
        fundamentals.
        <br />
        <br />I also had the opportunity to work on several exciting projects.
        My education has equipped me with the toolbox to transition into the
        world of tech and I am excited to improve my ability to code and build
        software!

        Throughout my academic and personal journey pursuing programming, I have
        engaged in various projects that helped me develop my skills and
        intuition. Some projects that I have created are:
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Cellular Automata of Traffic:</strong> Mathematically modelled
        flow of traffic on a single lane road via a simple cellular automata
        model with a periodic boundary condition to simulate driving in a loop
        and investigate how traffic build-ups evolve over time. It bears some
        resemblance to Conway's game of life which happened to be one of my
        friends first React projects.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Nearest Neighbour of N Points in Periodic Cube:</strong>{" "}
        Optimized prewritten code that found nearest neighbour for N number of
        points in a periodic cube (similar to lattice structures in crystals)
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Lunar Lander game:</strong> A lunar lander game made using
        matplotlib to make an interactive GUI
        <br />
        <br />
        This website too! I needed a starter project for React so I made this
        website. These projects have each been challenging in their own way and
        helped me grow quite a bit!

        I'm 22 years old, and enjoy hiking, cooking, and Brazilian jiu-jitsu to
        name a few of my hobbies.
        <br />
        <br />
        I've recently been interested in philosophy, so I read some books on
        stoicism. Obviously I enjoy physics so I'd like to start self studying
        to keep in touch.
        <br />
        <br />
        For most of my degree I didn't like quantum mechanics or particle
        physics but during my final year I took some unbelievable modules on
        theoretical particle physics and symmetry in physics which completely
        changed my mind on the subjects and now I'm a particle physicist.
        <br />
        <br />I produce music sometimes, so you can find my SoundCloud below.
        I've been listening to jungle recently so you might hear that soon.
        <br />
        <br /> Oh and I'm a gamer too, some of my favourite games would be
        League of Legends, Ghost of Tsushima, Monster Hunter, Call of Duty,
        Diablo 4 and Katana Zero.
